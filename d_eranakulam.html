            <h1>Eranakulam (kochi)</h1>
            <p>Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a city in southwest India's coastal Kerala state. It has been a port
                since 1341, when a flood carved out its harbor and opened it to Arab, Chinese and European merchants.
                Sites reflecting those influences include Fort Kochi, a settlement with tiled colonial bungalows and
                diverse houses of worship. Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for
                centuries.</p>
